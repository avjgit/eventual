	    <p>In a recent publication about similar services, &quot;Latvijas Avīze&quot; mentions</p>
	    <blockquote cite="http://www.la.lv/?materials=124">
		<p>Latvia based company &laquo;GTravel&raquo; is a promising startup with a 
		    growing user base.</p>
		<p>Just a year ago, in early 2012 two Latvian programmers 
		    Edžus Skudriņš and Olivers Lapsa started the project in order to simplify
		    organizing their own vacion travel. Currently they employ a team of 10 people
		    and provide 24/7 support to their customers.</p>
